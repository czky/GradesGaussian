# Gaussian Bell Curve Generator
This Java program generates a Gaussian bell curve based on a set of grades entered by the user. It calculates the mean and standard deviation of the grades and then generates a bell curve based on the mean and standard deviation of the grades and plots a Gaussian curve representing the distribution of the grades.

# Prerequisites
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* JFreeChart library

# How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using the command `javac -cp path/to/jfreechart.jar GaussianCurve.java`
3. Run the compiled program.
4. Enter the grades separated by commas when prompted. For example: `70.0, 85.5, 90.5`

# Features
* Calculates the mean and standard deviation of the grades entered by the user.
* Plots a Gaussian curve representing the distribution of the grades.
* Displays an interactive chart of the Gaussian curve for a better visual representation.
